# Spectrum Support Role Notes

- These notes are for Spectrum's Administrative Support Specialist role.

## Email

- It is the Administrative Support Specialst's job to manage the support@spectrumeval.com inbox.
- Refer to the [Email Forwarding Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FChdWbUHiZTNa_ynfq8n2owKMKgxQtFMSFdYvoCZxE/edit) to learn where to forward each email type received.
- Refer to the [Naming Convention Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppDsIhXifJeDZ9yeRdJAMxI5QP675jFPNutM84JQFrg/edit) to determine what to rename files. This naming convention should also be used for forwarded email subjects.
- You will also receive a few emails from Spectrum Administrator Leidy Garrett with one or more attachments named "Mail (Date)".
  - These documents contain multiple pieces of mail sent to Spectrum and therefore need to be separated using software capable of splitting PDFs.
  - Once separated and renamed using the previously mentioned naming convention, your task will be to distribute them to the appropriate departments in accordance with the email fowarding guide.
  - If you ever have any questions about where to send a document, feel free to either CC when forwarding or contact Cassandra for guidance.
- Some emails will contain records only accessible through a link. Sometimes credentials are required to access these, and if credentials aren't provided in the same email use the support email and password.
- Emails received from orlandomanagers@answernet.com are typically forwarded to scheduling or diagnostics depending on the reason in the template.

## Dialpad

- Spectrum's faxes are received via Dialpad and it is the Administrative Support Specialist's job to download, rename and distribute these documents to the appropriate departments.
- You will need to use software capable of splitting PDFs (similar to mail received from Leidy).
- Fax documents are then sent via email once or twice a week in large batches to the appropriate departments. It is recommended you have a folder on your computer to store these fax documents.
- NOTE: You will receive email notifications regarding these faxes. You can choose to process the faxes via these emails, but I find viewing them using the Dialpad software to be easier and to disregard the Dialpad emails.
